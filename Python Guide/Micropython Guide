Build the micropython firmware for the RP2040 using the .sh file

Upload the firmware.uf2 file to the pico

There are a few ways to interact with the pico using micropython

1) Thonny - IDE with built in uploading
    sudo python3 -m pip install thonny
python3 -m thonny
You should set the IDE to Raspberry Pi Pico mode

2) rshell - Terminal based, can upload main.py files to the pico
Install rshell to linux using pip
    sudo python3 -m pip install rshell
Now you can use rshell from a linux terminal
To upload a main.py file from the terminal's cwd (from within rshell)
cp main.py /pyboard/main.py

3) Minicom - Terminal for listening to serial and running single lines of python
    sudo apt install minicom
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
press ctrl+D to soft reboot the RPP
You now have a micropython terminal!


You can get a basic micropython guide by typing help() within the micropython
terminal

Look at the main.py file for an example of blink code
