Build the micropython firmware for the RP2040 using the .sh file

Upload the firmware.uf2 file to the pico

There are a few ways to interact with the pico with python
1 - Thonny for micropython
2 - minicom, for sending individual lines of code

--- 1 Thonny ---
sudo python3 -m pip install thonny
python3 -m thonny

--- 2 Minicom ---
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0
press ctrl+D to soft reboot the RPP
You now have a micropython terminal!
