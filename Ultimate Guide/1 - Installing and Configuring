--- Dependencies from apt ---

Here's a list of dependencies you should install:

git dependencies:
	git
	
SDK dependencies
	cmake
	gcc-arm-none-eabi
	gcc
	g++
	
UART dependencies
	minicom
	
sudo apt install git cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi gcc g++ minicom


--- Dependencies from git ---

necessary git repos:
	pico-sdk
	picotool
	
optional git repos:
	pico-examples
	pico-playground
	pico-extras
	picoprobe (this is for debugging a pico with another pico)
	
I'll walk through setting up the necessary git repos


--- pico-sdk
For pico-sdk, find somewhere on your pc that will never be moved. The 
sdk should stay in the same place, moving it will require a load of
commands and will be a pain.

e.g. in ~/raspberry

git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git

Now you need to create a permanent variable so that cmake knows where
you have your sdk.

export PICO_SDK_PATH=/home/tom/raspberry/pico-sdk

if you do choose to move the pico-sdk, you need to figure out how to
change the PICO_SDK_PATH variable (good luck!)

--- picotool
