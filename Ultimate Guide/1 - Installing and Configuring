--- Dependencies from apt ---

Here's a list of dependencies you should install:

git dependencies:
	git
	
SDK dependencies
	cmake
	gcc-arm-none-eabi
	gcc
	g++
	
UART dependencies
	minicom

picotool dependencies

On Debian distibutions you can run this
sudo apt install git cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi gcc g++ minicom libusb-1.0-0-dev


--- Dependencies from git ---

necessary git repos:
	pico-sdk
	picotool
	
optional git repos:
	pico-examples
	pico-playground
	pico-extras
	picoprobe (this is for debugging a pico with another pico)
	
I'll walk through setting up the necessary git repos


--- pico-sdk
(See end of section for copy-paste code!)
For pico-sdk, find somewhere on your pc that will never be moved. The 
sdk should stay in the same place, moving it will require a load of
commands and will be a pain.

e.g. in ~/raspberry

git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git

Now you need to create a permanent variable so that cmake knows where
you have your sdk.

export PICO_SDK_PATH=/home/tom/raspberry/pico-sdk

if you do choose to move the pico-sdk, you need to figure out how to
change the PICO_SDK_PATH variable (good luck, it's a pain!)

if you're so inclined, you can just copy the code below to do this all for you

cd ~/Documents &&
mkdir .pico-sdk &&
cd .pico-sdk &&
git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git &&
cd pico-sdk &&
export PICO_SDK_PATH=$PWD


--- picotool

Run the following commands

git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool.git &&
cd picotool &&
mkdir build &&
cd build &&
cmake .. &&
make &&
sudo cp picotool /usr/local/bin/ &&
cd ../.. &&
gio trash picotool

You now have the picotool command in your linux!
